## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Website Colour Scheme](assets/images/coolors.png)

The website uses bright and light colours using HEX numbers for more variety, such as the header section (1 opacity) with this I later decided that some text was not clear enough with the opacity from the navigation bar which needed to be clear to viewers at all times, but I didn't want to change the colour scheme, so instead simply set the opacity to 1 instead of 0.8.  I chose this palette to keep the website fun and vibrant so it stands out and attracts potential clients. The #000000 black will be used for text, as well as #ffffff white for coloured background sections such as the banner image text and the i kept #000000 color for hamberger icon and text and #ffff00 color for the background image. The colour palette was created using the Coolors website.

For the HEX codes for the social media hover states, I used google to find out the HEX colours to match the social media"s colours of their logos. These are the colours that google suggested:

Facebook logo: #666666
Instagram logo: #666666
Youtube logo: #666666
twitter: #666666

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Poppins is used for headings on the site. For all headings I am using the weight of 400. I"ll be using sans-serif as a fallback text incase of any errors with loading google fonts.
- Poppins is also used for the body text on the site. I"ll be using the weight of 300 for paragraph text and for for all the section a weight of 400. I"ll be using sans-serif as a fallback text incase of any errors with loading google fonts.

### Imagery

All pictures have permission to be used and are owned by myself. I have obtained all rights to the photos and do not need permission from the photographers and media.

## Features

## Bugs

- After deploying the website I found out that the images were broken in the gallery page. This was due to absolute file paths. I fixed it by removing the initial slash and making the file paths relative.
- In the deployed version, the background images for the rules and get in Register page were not covering the whole section on tablets and larger screens. I fixed it by adding a height property to the sections affected.

## Unsolved Bugs

- None.
